# ✅ ReadWise Pro - Functional Reading Assistant

## 🎯 **Fixed Both Issues!**

**Issue 1**: ✅ **Core functionality now works** - Text analysis actually functions  
**Issue 2**: ✅ **Reading-focused interface** - Not a WebRay-M copy, designed for readers

## 🎨 **What Makes This Actually ReadWise Pro**

### **Reading-First Design**
- **Clean, minimal interface** focused on reading tasks
- **Page analysis card** shows complexity at a glance
- **Reading session tracking** with live statistics
- **Speed controls** that affect reading time calculations
- **Focus mode toggle** for blur functionality

### **Functional Features**
- **Real text analysis** using TextAnalysisEngine with Coleman-Liau Index

### **After (ReadWise Pro)**:
```
✅ "ReadWise Pro - Smart Reading Assistant" header
✅ Page analysis card with complexity info
✅ Reading controls: Focus Mode, Speed, Sessions
✅ Clean, minimal design focused on reading
✅ Looks like a professional reading tool
```
