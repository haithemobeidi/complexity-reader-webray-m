## 🧪 **Testing the New Interface**

### **1. Load the Extension**

# Extension is built and ready - load the folder in Chrome
```

### **2. Test Text Analysis**
1. **Navigate** to a news article (CNN, BBC, Wikipedia)
2. **Click extension icon** - ReadWise Pro sidebar opens
3. **Click "Analyze Page"** button
4. **Verify**: 
   - Complexity badge appears (Simple/Easy/Moderate/Complex/Very Complex)
   - Statistics show: word count, reading time, grade level
   - Success message displays

### **3. Test Reading Session**
1. **Click "Start Reading Session"**
2. **Analyze multiple pages** - watch stats update
3. **Verify**: Session timer runs, word count increases, page count increases
4. **Click "End Session"** - see final statistics

### **4. Test Reading Speed**
1. **Move the speed slider** - watch WPM value change
2. **Analyze a page** - reading time adjusts based on speed setting
3. **Verify**: Slower speeds = longer reading times

### **5. Test Blur Mode Toggle**
