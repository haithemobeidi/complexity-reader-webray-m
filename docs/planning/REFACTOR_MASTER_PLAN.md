# ðŸ“‹ **WebRay-M Complexity Reader Refactor - Master Plan**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a complete refactor of the complexity-reader extension using WebRay-M's modular architecture as the foundation. The goal is to test WebRay-M's ability to accelerate extension development while fixing reliability issues present in the original extension.

**Objective**: Build a fully functional reading assistant extension that:
- Has 100% feature parity with the original complexity-reader
- Uses WebRay-M's enhanced reliability patterns (ContentScriptBridge)
- Follows WebRay-M's Material Design 3 principles
- Implements modular architecture for future module extraction
- Demonstrates WebRay-M's value as an extension development framework

## **Key Project Principles**

1. **Actual Refactoring**: Extract and rebuild working code from complexity-reader, don't just rename WebRay-M components
2. **Feature Parity**: Every feature from complexity-reader must work identically with enhanced reliability
3. **WebRay-M Integration**: Use framework properly - ContentScriptBridge, design system, modular architecture patterns
4. **Reliability First**: Fix the core instability issues that plague the original extension using WebRay-M patterns
5. **Modular Design**: Build for future module extraction to benefit WebRay-M ecosystem and other extensions
6. **Professional Quality**: Material Design 3, robust error handling, comprehensive testing, production-ready code
7. **Strategic Validation**: This refactor validates WebRay-M's value proposition and framework effectiveness

### **Framework Usage Philosophy**
- **Don't fight WebRay-M**: Use its patterns as intended, don't force original complexity-reader patterns
- **Embrace modular architecture**: Build modules that could work independently or in other extensions  
- **Leverage ContentScriptBridge**: Replace problematic injection patterns with reliable WebRay-M patterns
- **Use the design system**: Don't rebuild UI components that WebRay-M already provides
- **Document learnings**: Track what works, what doesn't, and what could be improved in WebRay-M
- **Build for extraction**: Every major component should be designed as a potential WebRay-M module
